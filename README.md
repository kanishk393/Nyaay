## Legal Literacy Platform - Nyaay

Welcome to this repository! This project aims to provide quickly consumable legal literacy tips to the masses, empowering individuals with knowledge of their legal rights and responsibilities. The platform will have three phases, offering a comprehensive solution to legal queries and concerns.

### Phase 1: Indian Constitution Repository

In the initial phase, we organized the Indian Constitution in a user-friendly manner, allowing easy access to relevant laws, articles, and sub-sections. Users can search for specific rules and explore both the original text of the Constitution and simplified detailed versions. The simplified versions will include practical examples and real-life cases to enhance understanding. This phase focuses on providing legal literacy in a comprehensive and accessible format.

### Phase 2: Online Community and Discussion Forum

For users who require further assistance in resolving their legal issues, Phase 2 introduces an online community of individuals interested in the law, including practicing lawyers. We have developed a robust discussion forum where users can ask questions, share their problems, and engage in fruitful discussions with other community members. Verified lawyer profiles will also be available to provide expert advice and guidance. This phase encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing within the legal community.

### Phase 3: Lawyer Hiring and Consultation

When users require personalized legal assistance, Phase 3 offers a seamless connecting process with suitable lawyers. Our platform provides a curated list of lawyer options based on user requirements. Users can explore the profiles and expertise of various lawyers and quickly initiate contact with their desired legal representative. This final phase ensures a streamlined experience, offering a one-stop solution for all legal problems in India.
